title: "I never thought AI would replace full-stack developers, but now I doubt"

A few years ago, I would have laughed if someone told me AI could replace full-stack developers. Building applications requires a skill set that takes years of training, iteration, and learning. But now, I’m not so sure.

## What Made Me Doubt

A few days ago, I tried using the KIMI 2.5 agentic AI to create an end-to-end full-stack application using the MERN stack. Yes, it actually created an application. Did it work perfectly the first time? No. But what made me question our existence was that even the bugs were solved by the IDE Antigravity. After hours of problem-solving without me intervening, it made the application work exactly as I wanted.

## What Made Me Doubt Only But Not Sure

After the application was working as expected, I gave it another task: to create a complete authentication flow with sign-in, sign-up, and separate pages based on user roles. Guess what? It failed. It generated numerous errors that could not be fixed without a technically skilled human. AI can write code for now, but it still requires human intervention to make it functional. The application wasn’t production-ready; it could break under increased user load and lacked focus on user experience and finer details.

## It’s Just a Matter of Time

AI only entered the mainstream in 2022, when ChatGPT launched. Since then, development has been rapid. I’m not writing this based on hype. Top leaders often exaggerate AI’s capabilities for profit, but I am writing based on my personal experience. I’ve watched AI evolve from its early stages to where it is now, and it’s fascinating. In such a short span of time, if it has advanced this much, imagine what it could achieve in the next four years when AI development is potentially twice as advanced.
